# How to reconstruct Enterprise G
</div>

[![EnterpriseG Reconstruction Process](https://img.youtube.com/vi/)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-bu1me3Vc4 "EnterpriseG Reconstruction Process")

`All you need to provide is:`
- Windows 10/11 Pro en-US install.wim image without updates (XXXXX.1)

> [**UUP Dump**](https://uupdump.net/) can create a Windows Pro ISO in en-US without updates (untick the **Include updates (Windows converter only)** box).
> 
**Hot tip:** If you build a fresh ISO using UUP Dump, set `AppsLevel` to **1** inside `ConvertConfig.ini` on build 22621 and later, this will only install Windows Security and the Microsoft Store as apps preinstalled! Additionally, on 26100 and later, setting `SkipEdge` to **1** wont preinstall Microsoft Edge or Webview.
> 
Supported Builds: 
- [17763](https://uupdump.net/download.php?id=6ce50996-86a2-48fd-9080-4169135a1f51&pack=en-us&edition=professional) (1809), [19041](https://uupdump.net/download.php?id=a80f7cab-84ed-43f4-bc6b-3e1c3a110028&pack=en-us&edition=professional) (2004), [22000](https://uupdump.net/download.php?id=6cc7ea68-b7fb-4de1-bf9b-1f43c6218f6f&pack=en-us&edition=professional) (21H2), [22621](https://uupdump.net/download.php?id=356c1621-04e7-4e66-8928-03a687c3db73&pack=en-us&edition=professional) (22H2 & 23H2) & [26100](https://uupdump.net/download.php?id=3d68645c-e4c6-4d51-8858-6421e46cb0bb&pack=en-us&edition=professional) (24H2)


`How to get started:`
1. Place install.wim in the directory of the script
2. Adjust config.ini if necessary
3. Run **Build.ps1** in PowerShell as Administrator

> Run this command in Powershell if Build.ps1 is not starting. **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass**
> 
Once the reconstruction process is complete, you will find the new `install.wim` file in the same folder where you placed the original install.wim file. (**Please note:** your original `install.wim` file has been overwritten and cannot be restored!)
To proceed, you can create a new ISO using AnyBurn or any similar software. If you have already created a bootable Windows installation USB drive, simply copy the new `install.wim` file and replace the existing one located in the `sources` directory of your USB drive.

# Known "issues" with Enterprise G reconstruction
</div>

- Inplace upgrade might get undone/reverted on some builds of Windows (e.g 19041 -> 22000/22621.) (looking for a fix)
- Windows might not be activated on 26100 installs due to the new setup in 24H2 (Workaround: Use previous setup or activate windows using MAS afterwards)
- No ARM64 or 32 Bit support. This project only covers X86_64/AMD64 (64 Bit PCs support only)

# Important
I'm not actively maintaining this project. I'll push some commits here and there to ensure support for future Windows builds and some optimizations, that's it. This project requires some knowledge. No support will be provided.

THIS PROJECT DOES NOT DEBLOAT WINDOWS. It replaces Windows Pro with the Windows Enterprise G SKU used by various government entities. Enterprise G comes with some product policies applied by default, such as a disabled Windows Defender antivirus and reduced telemetry.

While some parts of the Chinese government, for example, use this exact edition of Windows, they have additional modifications that are not available to the general public.

If you're actually interested in running the exact same version as them, you're better off Googling "Windows 10 Enterprise G CMGE_V2020-L.1207" â€“ there are leaks circulating around.

You shouldn't be using this daily, unless you really want to. This is just for fun.
